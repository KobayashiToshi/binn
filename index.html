  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <section>
    <h3 id="purpose_of_this_document">Purpose of This Document</h3>
    <p>Each cultural community has its own language, script and writing system. In that sense, the transfer of each writing system into cyberspace is a task with very high importance for information and communication technology.</p>
    <p>As one of the basic work items of this task force, this document describes issues of text <a href="#term.composition" class="termref">composition</a> in the Japanese writing system. The goal of the task force is not to propose actual solutions but describe important issues as basic information for actual implementations.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="how_this_document_was_created">How This Document was Created</h3>
    <p>This document was created by the W3C Japanese Layout Task Force. The Task Force has discussed many issues and harmonized the requirements from user communities and solutions from technological experts. It includes the following participants: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Japanese text composition
          experts (The editors of "JIS X 4051 : Formatting rules for Japanese documents").</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Internationalization and standardization experts in Japan (from Microsoft, Antenna House, JustSystems).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Members of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">i18n Core</a>,
          Working Groups.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This task force also constitutes an important innovation due to its bilingual work-flow. Discussion is mainly conducted in Japanese, because
      of the Japanese <a href="#term.composition" class="termref2nd">composition</a> issues, but minutes and one mailing list were in English. To support  development, the task force
      held face-to-face meetings with participating Working Groups.</p>
    <p>The document itself was also developed bilingually, and is published bilingually. We carefully avoided
      using jargon for technical terms. Even if there were English words corresponding to the Japanese, we carefully studied any potential differences
      in the nuances of meaning, and if there were differences between corresponding concepts, we provided the Japanese
      jargon in romaji (Latin transliteration) for future discussion. Moreover, we prepared as many figures as possible, with clear
      and understandable English, to help non-Japanese readers. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="basic_principles_for_development_of_this_document">Basic Principles for Development of This Document</h3>
    <p>Japanese composition exhibits several differences from Western composition. Major differences include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The use of not only horizontal writing mode but also vertical writing mode.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In principle, all <a href="#term.character-frame" class="termref">character frames</a> of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters
          used in Japanese composition are designed in a square box, and these characters are composed without intervening spaces (i.e. set solid). In this document, notations such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> characters indicate character classes (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes">3.9 About Character Classes</a>).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This document mainly explains the characteristics of Japanese composition along the lines of the following policy.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It does not fully cover all issues of the Japanese composition system, but mainly discusses the differences from Western composition systems. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It focuses on the requirements for the Japanese visual presentation form of text composition. Technology-specific interpretations
          of the requirements and/or how to implement them are out of scope for this document. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It explicitly refers to JIS X 4051 "Formatting rules for Japanese documents" as much as possible. This document focuses on fundamental and important issues of Japanese layout as much as possible, and for more detail
          references the corresponding clause of JIS X 4051. The   JIS X 4051 topics that are not described in this document, are only  for exceptional, corner cases or to provide some specific line composition algorithms. On the other hand, some topics that are not described in JIS X 4051 are described in detail. Accordingly, this document is sufficient to implement Japanese layout processing for most parts of the Japanese market. </p>
        <p>In accordance with the stated policy, this document provides tutorial- or summary-like, supplementary explanations, related background, and additional
          descriptions for JIS X 4051 information. This document covers all the fundamental issues of Japanese text layout, but the reader will need to refer to JIS X 4051 for advanced  discussion of exceptional topics. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It provides typical examples of actual use for key composition features, to enable better understanding of their usage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For non-Japanese readers, frequency of use is indicated for each requirement. These frequencies are not the outcome of any accurate
          research, but arise from the long experience of the authors. They are intuitive for ordinary Japanese text readers; however, for non-Japanese readers it may be difficult to imagine without explicit information. These frequencies are only
          rough information to prioritize the importance of issues. A couple of examples: </p>
        <p>"warichu (inline cutting note) is not frequently used, but is useful to simply annotate persons, things, and so on, at the place where the text appears, especially in
          classic texts or translations.",  or
          "ruby is frequently used in modern documents, including newspapers." </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In consideration of non-Japanese readers of this document, figures are used for explanations wherever possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Text layout rules and recommendations for readable design are different things, however these two issues are difficult to
          discuss independently. In this document, these two aspects are carefully separated. The aesthetic design recommendations are
          mainly described using notes. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The main target of this document is common books. The authors' experiences are mainly related to common books, and the quality
          required for common books is the highest in the market. There are many kinds of books in the market, and the requirements are quite
          diverse. The task force has a lot of accumulated experience in requirements and solutions for Japanese text composition. Nonetheless, many issues, which have been discussed over a long period of time, are applicable for other kinds of publication.</p>
        <p>In terms of frequency
          of use, the importance of magazines, technical manuals, and Web documents
          rates alongside
          common books. However, there are several characteristics in these publications, which are different from common books. These issues should be treated more fully in future documents.</p>

    <p><a class="sec_ref" href="#basics_of_japanese_composition">2 Basics of Japanese Composition</a> explains the characteristics of letters and symbols which are used in Japanese composition, their differences in <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a> and <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>, and the design and adaptation of the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a>.</p>
    <p><a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition">3 Line Composition</a> explains line composition
      methods for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters and <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref">punctuation marks</a>, together with ruby
      (inter-line pronunciation information and annotation) and <a href="#term.japanese-and-western-mixed-text-composition" class="termref">Japanese and Western mixed text composition</a>, i.e. mixtures of Japanese characters and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a>.</p>
    <p> <a class="sec_ref" href="#hanmen-design">4 Positioning of Headings, Notes, Illustrations, Tables and Paragraphs</a> describes

    <p>In principle, characters in Japanese composition are designed in a square box and positioned without spaces, i.e. <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">solid setting</a>. This is taken as a basic premise for the design of the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref2nd">kihon-hanmen</a>, the basis of book layout. Furthermore, to understand Japanese layout, it is important to understand the design of the kihon-hanmen and how to position illustrations, characters, symbols etc. in relation to it. Hence, <a class="sec_ref" href="#basics_of_japanese_composition">2 Basics of Japanese Composition</a> describes in detail the design of the kihon-hanmen and its dependencies. In particular, <a class="sec_ref" href="#page_wise_arrangement_of_kihonhanmen_elements">2.5 Page wise Arrangement of Kihon-hanmen Elements</a> provides prototypical patterns for the three guidelines listed after this paragraph: what recommendations need to be strictly taken into account, and what exceptions are possible. (The goal of these explanations is an understanding of Japanese composition. Since detailed explanations of the various elements of the kihon-hanmen are given in <a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition">3 Line Composition</a> and <a class="sec_ref" href="#hanmen-design">4 Positioning of Headings, Notes, Illustrations, Tables and Paragraphs</a>, some explanations are repeated.)</p>

    <h3 id="reference_of_definition_and_others">Reference of Definition and Others</h3>
    <p>The definitions of technical terms are described in the <a class="sec_ref" href="#terminology">Appendix G Terminology</a> appendix. Terms are linked to corresponding places in the Terminology appendix only at first appearance and in important places. If there is no appropriate English terminology for Japanese terminology, or the English terminology may possibly cause misunderstanding, the Japanese terminology is only transliterated to Hepburn style romaji notation (except that "m", not "n", is used  before "b", "m" and "p"). </p>
    <p>Also, the definitions of terminology in the Terminology appendix are basically the same as the definitions of JIS X 8125 or JIS X 4051, with respect to common Japanese usage of terminology. </p>
    <p>Each character class has its own character class number in parentheses. Members of each character class are listed in <a class="sec_ref" href="#character_classes">Appendix A Character Classes</a>, except for CJK Ideographs.
      Each character in this document is named and referred to using the character names of ISO/IEC 10646 (UCS). </p>

One method involves reducing by the same amount of inter-character space (<a href="#term.even-tsumegumi" class="termref">even tsumegumi</a> or tracking, see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_11-en"></a>) and the other involves determining  the amount of space to reduce based on the distance between the two letter faces of adjacent characters (<a href="#term.face-tsumegumi" class="termref">face tsumegumi</a> or letter face kerning, see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_12-en"></a>).</p>

                <p> In the <a href="#term.main-text" class="termref">main text</a> of books, the most reader-friendly approach is to use <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">solid setting</a>. However, if the character size is larger, the distance between characters may become unbalanced, and tsumegumi will be applied. For example, there are books where tsumegumi
                  is used with headings
                  set in large character sizes. These methods are rarely used in books, since ease of reading is very important, but in magazines or advertisements there are many more examples of tsumegumi.
                  Magazines tend to use type to differentiate themselves from others, and so devices like this are sometimes used for that purpose.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#term.page-format" class="termref">page format</a> of a Japanese document is specified by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Firstly, preparing a template of the page format, which determines the basic appearance of pages of the document;</p>

    <section>
      <h4 id="basic_templates_of_page_formats">Basic Templates of Page Formats</h4>
      <p>Generally, books use only one template for <a href="#term.page-format" class="termref">page format</a>, whereas magazines often use several templates.</p>
      <p>Although in books, as will be mentioned in c of <a class="sec_ref" href="#kihonhanmen_and_examples_of_real_page_format"></a>, there tends to be one template for the page format, the basic pattern is typically adapted. For example, the <a href="#term.table-of-contents" class="termref">table of contents</a> may contain small modifications. Furthermore, there are many examples of <a href="#term.index" class="termref">indexes</a> with a different page format than the basic page format, and vertically set books often have indexes in horizontal writing mode and sometimes multiple columns.
        This still holds true where the goal is to make the size of the <a href="#term.hanmen" class="termref">hanmen</a> for indexes close to the size of hanmen in the basic page format.</p>
      <p>Magazines gather articles of different kinds. Often the page format will differ depending on the content of the article. For example, one part may have 9 point character size and 3 columns, and another part 8 point character size and 4 columns.</p>

      <p>Establishing a <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a> may be seen as defining not only a rectangular area on a page, but also within that area an underlying, logical grid, to guide the placement of such things as characters, <a href="#term.heading" class="termref">headings</a>, and <a href="#term.illustrations" class="termref">illustrations</a>.  However, once a kihon-hanmen is established, there is no absolute requirement to align characters with the grid, especially when setting characters inside a line.  The only factors that influence the placement of characters are strong gravitational forces that (i) attract the first and last characters on a line to align with the border of the kihon-hanmen, and (ii) attract each line position to the line positions on which the kihon-hanmen is based.</p>
            <p>It may help in understanding the basic concepts of Japanese layout and kihon-hanmen to think in terms of a slit-based model, rather than a grid-based model. Each slit is the full length of the lines on which the kihon-hanmen is based.</p>

      <p>Depending on the application, character sizes can be specified in multiple ways. For books, character size is mainly specified using points or Q/q. Points are used for letterpress printing. In JIS Z 8305 (size units of printing type), one point is determined to be 0.3514mm. This is the size that is usually used. However, some  commonly used applications adopt one point as 1/72 inch, ca. 0.3528mm. Q was used for photo typesetting. One Q is 0.25mm. It is very difficult to unify the unit sizes for character size specifications, because actual users prefer the unit to which they are accustomed.

          <p>To set a heading, first establish a rectangular space based on a number of lines in the kihon-hanmen.  For example, a '3 line space' means (3 * the size of the character frame used for the kihon-hanmen + 2 * the line gap in the kihon-hanmen).  (Details of this processing are defined in JIS X 4051, sec. 8.3.3.d). The heading text is usually set in the centre of the rectangular space in the <a href="#term.block-direction" class="termref">block direction</a>, and indented from the line head. The size of the indent is usually specified as a number of characters in the kihon-hanmen.  For example, a '4 character indent' means (4 * the size of the character frames used for establishing the kihon-hanmen). (See the example at <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_1-en"></a>.)</p>

      <p>Japanese <a href="#term.composition" class="termref">composition</a> has two <a href="#term.text-direction" class="termref">text directions</a>. One is vertical direction (<a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a>), the other is horizontal direction (<a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>).</p>
      <aside class="note"><p><a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">Ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters for Japanese composition have basically been designed to have a square
              character frame from the letterpress printing era on. Thus the same collection of <a href="#term.printing-types" class="termref">printing types</a> can be used in either vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode, simply by changing the direction of text, (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_13-en"></a>). There were some attempts to develop <a href="#term.printing-types" class="termref">printing types</a> designed exclusively for horizontal writing mode, but they were not widely accepted.</p>

      <p>There is little market data comparing the number of pages with vertical writing mode  and horizontal writing mode, but it is said that both are almost the same.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
      <p>For official (e.g. governmental) documentation, horizontal writing mode is recommended. Educational material (with the exception
              of certain topics) is mostly in horizontal writing mode. Readers of "mobile novels" are increasing, and it
              is expected that in the future horizontal writing mode will increase in this area as well. However, most of the large newspapers
              are written completely in vertical writing mode, and most of the large journals for ordinary readers are almost completely set in vertical writing mode. In addition, novels, which are the most widely read kind of book publication, are almost completely in vertical writing mode
              (some readers say that they cannot read a novel if it is not in vertical writing mode). Hence it can be expected that the importance
              of vertical writing mode for Japanese will not change for the time being.</p>

          <p>In Western text layout, 10 point (about 3.5mm) or 12 point (about 4.2mm) type is common. This is mainly because of a difference in design principles between Japanese and Latin characters.</p>

                  The basic line gap isn't changed where warichu occurs (the line gap between warichu itself and the adjacent lines looks narrower than for the rest of the line), so when warichu is likely to occur in text, the line gap for the kihon-hanmen may be set slightly larger than normal to accommodate it.
                  The same is true for <a href="#term.tate-chu-yoko" class="termref">tate-chu-yoko</a> or <a href="#term.subscript" class="termref">subscript</a> and <a href="#term.superscript" class="termref">superscript</a> (<a href="#term.ornament-characters" class="termref">ornament characters</a>).

Line feed is the distance between two adjacent lines measured from their reference points (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_20-en"></a>). The reference point differs from implementation to  implementation, however, in vertical writing mode the horizontal center of the character frame is usually used, and with horizontal writing mode, the vertical center of the character frame is used.

The same applies in cases where ruby, <a href="#term.underline" class="termref">underline</a>, etc. appear beyond the after edge of the hanmen.

          <p>When inserting more than one illustration or table item in horizontal writing mode, assuming that there is no text to the left or right of the items, the items may either slip off the lines established for the kihon-hanmen (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_10-en"></a>), or stick to the lines (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_11-en"></a>). The former approach is used,
            whenever possible,
            to achieve inter-character spacing before and after illustrations or tables constant. (This method is often used in books.) (This processing method is defined in JIS X 4051, sec. 10.3.2., d.)</p>

However, as already shown in some of the previous figures, there are examples where this is not the case. Such cases are rather common, and here we will show some prototypical examples (details will be given in <a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition"></a>).</p>
      <aside class="note">
      <p>Where character sizes differ from the solid set sizes established for the kihon-hanmen, line lengths may not be identical with the <a href="#term.line-length" class="termref">line length</a> of the kihon-hanmen; it is necessary to align the ends of the lines, with the exception of the last line in a paragraph.

        <li>
          <p>In cases where proportional Latin letters are rotated 90 degrees clockwise (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_20-en"></a>), the proportional letters are placed according to their <a href="#term.proportional" class="termref">proportional</a> widths. Hence, they do not fit to the character positions established for the kihon-hanmen (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_13-en"></a>).

            (details are explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head"></a>). Because an opening bracket is not a full-width character, in  cases where the indentation of the first line of a paragraph is a <a href="#term.one-em-space" class="termref">one em space</a>, or if the <a href="#term.tentsuki" class="termref">tentsuki</a> position is used for the bracket (that is, there is no space at the line head), the character following the bracket will be in a position which does not fit to the character positions established for the kihon-hanmen (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_14-en"></a>). However, the adaptations made during the alignment of line ends will ensure that the character at the end of a line is at a position that fits with the kihon-hanmen.</p>

            these occupy in effect a full-width size. However, if they are adjacent to other punctuation marks or brackets,

            space than the <a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">character size</a> in the kihon-hanmen.</p>
        </li>

          <p>Regardless of the direction of text in the kihon-hanmen of a book, horizontal running heads and page numbers on the left page

            left edge. On the right page, the tail of the running heads or page numbers should be aligned either at the right edge of the kihon-hanmen
            or one full-width space to left of the right edge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Regardless of the direction of text in a book, when arranging running heads and page numbers together on the same horizontal line, the space between the running head and the page number
            should be double or one and a half times the character size of the running head. On the left page, the page number should be set at the left side and the running head should be set at the right side. On right-hand pages, the page number should be set at the right side and the running head should be set at the left side. The exact positions of the page numbers are given by the instructions above (see b).</p>

          <p>When positioning running heads and page numbers vertically to the <a href="#term.fore-edge" class="termref">fore-edge</a> of the kihon-hanmen in a vertically set book  (see spread (e) in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_28-en"></a>, for example), the minimum horizontal distance from the kihon-hanmen should be the same as that of the <a href="#term.line-gap" class="termref">line gap</a> of the kihon-hanmen.
            The top of the running head should be positioned approximately four kihon-hanmen characters below the head, and the bottom of the page numbers should be positioned approximately five kihon-hanmen characters

          <p>In the double running head method, a higher-level title, such as that of the chapter or book, is used for the running heads on the even pages, and a lower-level title, such as that for a section, on the odd pages.

                  make much sense to use the book title for the running head. The most common approach for a book with three levels of headings, such as chapter, section and subsection, is to use the highest  level heading (i.e. chapter) and the second level heading (i.e. section).</p>

            for example in manuals, the method of starting each chapter from page number "1". (In such cases, it is

For example,  Arabic numbers are used for both continuous pagination and reverse pagination, but for reverse pagination, brackets are added around the numbers.</p>

      <p>There are some <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref">punctuation marks</a> that are used uniquely in either <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a> or <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>. In this document, characters and symbols are treated as members of a character class, classified by their behavior for <a href="#term.composition" class="termref">composition</a>. Each class name is followed by class id, such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>. Details are explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes"></a>. The following are some typical examples:</p>

              <p> In horizontal writing mode, there are many cases of composition that mixes Japanese and Western text. The convention shown in (i) is a way to apply the same
                    comma and full stop
                    to both Western and Japanese texts for consistency, and is common in books on science and technology. The convention shown in (ii) was invented because in (i) <span class="character">FULL STOP "."</span> appears too small for Japanese texts and using <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP "。"</span> for period looks better. This convention has been adopted for Japanese official publications. (In the past, <span class="character">COMMA ","</span> and <span class="character">FULL STOP "."</span> were used for some official publications.)</p>

      <aside class="note">
              <p>Basic processing of characters and symbols, including punctuation marks, which are subject to considerations of <a href="#term.line-head" class="termref">line head</a> wrapping, <a href="#term.line-end" class="termref">line end</a> wrapping and inter-character space adjustment, will be described in detail in <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes"></a>.

Space is inserted before and after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dots (cl-05)</a>.

For example, when <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> are implemented with full-width size, it is possible  that a minus half em space is inserted between adjacent <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> (Some implementations prepare minus <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref">half em spaces</a> and <a href="#term.quarter-em-space" class="termref">quarter em spaces</a>).  In <a href="#term.letterpress-printing" class="termref">letterpress printing</a>, it was also common practice to combine punctuation marks with a half-width body and half em spaces in order to make it easier to remove the space later for adjustment. Because of that, the types were picked up except for the punctuation marks at the <a href="#term.type-picking" class="termref">type-picking</a> phase, following the manuscript, and the punctuation marks were picked only when they were necessary in composing a page. Later, with the increasing adoption of Monotype machines, punctuation marks with a full-width body became popular and both full-width and half-width punctuation marks have been used, mixed together, since then.</p>

      <p>Japanese composition is based on the design of full-width characters, but strictly following full-width based composition
            sometimes produces an unbalanced appearance. In such exceptional cases, the appearance of the resulting composition must
            be given higher priority than the full-width design principle. When and how to invoke such exceptional procedures has a direct
            bearing on the quality of the text layout. In other words, it is a matter of how to resolve the conflicts between the principle

      <h4 id="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head">Positioning of Opening Brackets at Line Head</h4>
      <p>When starting a <a href="#term.paragraph-break" class="termref">new line</a> with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> there are some patterns as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a>. Note that the amount of line indent after the line feed (the first line indent of a new paragraph) is assumed to be a <a href="#term.one-em-space" class="termref">one em space</a> across all the patterns.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set full-width (one em) and the next line after the first line break starts with no space (so-called <a href="#term.tentsuki" class="termref">tentsuki</a>) (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ①).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set one and a half em and the next line indent after the first line
            break is set to a half em (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ②).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set at a half em and the next line after the first line break is set tentsuki (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ③).</p>

      <aside class="note">
      <p>Because the inherent character width of a bracket is half-width, <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ① can be explained as the result of applying the principle that any line should start with no space. On the other hand, the principle represented by <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ② is to assume that opening brackets should be always accompanied by the preceding half em
            space
            as if they were full-width and then apply the same principle as in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ①. JIS X 4051 adopts the principle shown in ① (the patterns shown in ② is offered as options) . The pattern shown in ③ was first invented in books such as novels, which use frequent line feeds and corner brackets in dialogues, for which the first line indent with one em
            
            space
            or one and a half em
            space
            (then this pattern was accepted and adopted by general books). Major Japanese publishers who deal with literature, such as Kodansha, Shinchosha, Bungei Shunju, Chuoh Kouronsha, and Chikuma Shobo, have adopted the pattern shown in ③. By contrast, Iwanami Shoten and other publishers adopted the pattern shown in ①. Because Iwanami Shoten once adopted pattern ② in vertical composition, there used to be many examples of it, but few examples of ② can be found today.</p>

      <p>The first line indent of a new paragraph is full-width in principle. However, the following exceptions can be found.</p>

                <p>The most popular scheme is to set the first line indent of all new paragraphs to full-width.

(There are books such as novels which adopt full-width line indent without exception.)

However, the position between ideographic numerals and <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span> used as a decimal separator or an indicator for approximate number, and <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span> used as a decimal point is unbreakable. The reason is that the natural usage of ideographic numerals is to write them like "二百三十五", that is with inserted rank indicators (Explanation: "二" means "two", "百" means "hundred". "二百" means "two hundred". "三" means "three", "十" means "ten". "三十" means "thirty"."五" means "five". The complete sequence "二百三十五" means "Two hundred and thirty five".). Hence, it is not necessary to express rank via position. In contrast, line breaks are forbidden for European numerals, since it is necessary to express the rank via the position.

      <h4 id="examples_of_line_adjustment">Examples of Line Adjustment</h4>
      <p>Methods of line adjustment processing are discussed in <a class="sec_ref" href="#line_adjustment"></a>. However, since layout processing
        of punctuation marks is one reason for the need for line adjustment processing, we will here introduce two main examples of cases where
        line adjustment processing is necessary, and show adjustment examples (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The principal approach in Japanese composition is that with the exception of the last line of a paragraph, the length of all lines
            is the same, so all lines are aligned. As explained before, the line length is set to be n-times the character size established for the kihon-hanmen. Hence, as long as only full-width
            characters are used, all lines have the same length (see ① at <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a> at ②, there is an <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span> followed by a <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span>, and  the total space taken by the two characters is one and a half em. That means that the line overshoots or runs short of the edge of the kihon-hanmen by a half em. To restore a uniform line length, line adjustment is applied as shown at ③ in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>. The <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref2nd">half em space</a> overshoot or shortage is recovered by <a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-reduction" class="termref">reducing inter-character space</a> to a quarter em before the <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span> and after the <span class="character">RIGHT CORNER BRACKET "」"</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>At ④ in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>, the 15th character is an <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a>. This should not appear  at the line end. Ideally, a full
            width space reduction would be applied, and the character "前" on the second line would be moved onto the first line in the
            15th position. In that way, the problem could be avoided. However, in this example a full-width space reduction is not possible,
            so line adjustment processing is applied as shown at ⑤ in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>. The <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a> is moved to the second line, and <a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-expansion" class="termref">line adjustment by inter-character space expansion</a> is applied. That means that space is inserted in the first line at places where it is allowed.</p>

      <p>There are a lot of examples of Japanese text in which Western and/or Greek letters are mixed among Japanese letters. Examples
        are as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Using one Latin letter as a symbol for something, like "A" and "B".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using a Western word in a Japanese context, like "editor".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using acronyms of things and organization names, like "DTP" and "GDP".</p>

        <li>
          <p>Writing Western book titles and authors in lists of referred books with original spelling.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Latin letters are also used in <a href="#term.itemization" class="termref">itemized lists</a> and numbering of <a href="#term.heading" class="termref">headings</a>, as well as symbols for units, symbols for chemical elements,
        and mathematical symbols. As can be judged from these examples, mixtures of Latin letters among Japanese letters are in daily use
        in Japanese composition.</p>
      <aside class="note">
      <p>There are some examples which include whole Western paragraphs in Japanese documents.  However, there are few ordinary books that
            include such paragraphs. There are a lot of examples of textbooks for foreign languages,
            in which one or more Western paragraphs are followed by annotations in Japanese language. Also, there are some examples in treatises and journals, which contain whole Western paragraphs.</p>

      <h4 id="mixed_text_composition_in_vertical_writing_mode">Mixed Text Composition in Vertical Writing Mode</h4>
      <p>As explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#major_differences_between_vertical_writing_mode_and_horizontal_writing_mode"></a>, there are three different styles for setting Latin letters and European
        numerals in vertical writing mode:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Setting Latin letters and/or European numerals one by one in inline direction with <a href="#term.japanese-characters" class="termref">Japanese characters</a> (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_2_2_50-en"></a>).
            
            Single Latin letters or Arabic numerals are set with this style. In this case, a full width monospace font is
            usually  used. Currently,
            proportional Western style fonts are also sometimes used with this style. </p>
          <figure id="fig_2_2_50-en">

	<figcaption>Example of Latin letters in normal orientation.</figcaption>
	</figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Setting Latin letters and/or European numerals rotated 90 degrees clockwise in vertical text mode (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_2_6-en"></a>). This style is usually adopted when Latin letters compose a word or sentence. Proportional fonts are specified for
            characters in this style, as in horizontal writing mode (or half-width fonts for European numerals).</p>
          <figure id="fig2_2_6-en">

	</figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Setting Latin letters and/or European numerals in <a href="#term.tate-chu-yoko" class="termref">tate-chu-yoko</a> (horizontal-in-vertical setting, see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_2_7-en"></a>). Tate-chu-yoko layout is usually adopted when dealing with a two-digit number in European numerals, or a combination of
            two or three Latin letters, the length of which is equal to the default size of the line in paragraph direction or longer

      <p>Societal change in the use of kanji  when composing Japanese and changes in the use of ruby implementations in text layout methods
            have been affecting the usage of ruby itself. Ruby was not very popular while the Touyou Kanji Table  (当用漢字表) (the list of kanji characters for everyday use, issued by the
            Government on November 16, 1946) was in effect because, in principle, it discouraged the use of furigana in its 'directions     for use' section. The <a href="#term.jouyou-kanji-table" class="termref">Jouyou Kanji Table</a> (常用漢字表) (the list of kanji characters in common use, issued by the Government to replace the <a href="#term.touyou-kanji-table" class="termref">Touyou Kanji Table</a> on October
            10, 1981) has changed the scope of the list. (The Touyou Kanji Table defined the list of all kanji characters that can be used for
            any documents, while the Jouyou Kanji Table was designed to be a 'reference guide' for the use of kanji to compose contemporary
            Japanese for general use in society.)
            For example, the preface of the Jouyou Kanji Table states that one may consider the use of 'furigana (annotations to indicate pronunciation)'  when the text appears too
            difficult to read. This is why the use of ruby has been increasing today. The use of ruby is common in magazines and books,
            and even newspapers have begun to use ruby these days.</p>

              <p> Add one or more <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby character to indicate the reading (Japanese onyomi or kunyomi) for each base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_2-en"></a>).

      <p> Books commonly adopt kana-based jukugo-ruby for ideographic <a href="#term.compound-word" class="termref2nd">compound words</a>. However, due to technical difficulties for rendering jukugo-ruby in machine-assisted text layout, the adoption of kana-based mono-ruby is increasing. For example, newspapers do not use jukugo-ruby, and study aids generally use mono-ruby because it is considered more important to show the readings of each <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> for students than to be concerned about the beauty of the layout.</p>

      <p> Multiple ideographic <a href="#term.compound-word" class="termref2nd">compound words</a> can form one compound phrase. In this case, there are two ways to attach ruby, i.e. attaching ruby
                        to the compound phrase as a whole, or to each word which forms the compound (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_5-en"></a>). Similarly, a Japanese personal name consists of a given name and a family name, which together form a compound of a full
                        name, and it is an editorial decision whether to attach two runs of ruby, one each for given name and family name, or to attach the
                        full ruby text to the compound which represents the reading of the full name. </p>

          <p>PURPOSE: Ruby annotation that annotates a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> word with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> to provide its meaning, together with it's reading. In terms of ruby layout, attaching ruby text to a single character in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> is essentially the same as attaching the reading to a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> (e.g. attaching ruby text "バザール", 'Bazaar', in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> to a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> "市" is just like attaching the reading "いち" to that character). When attaching <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> ruby text to a run of base text consisting of two or more characters in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> and/or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, the ruby text needs to be positioned as if it corresponds to the annotated text itself, no matter how the ruby characters are distributed across each base character. The most typical example of this is attaching ruby text to a kanji compound word to indicate a corresponding loan word in katakana (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_6_2-en"></a>). The use of ruby text of this kind is on the increase in proportion to the growing need for translations and loan words. This type of ruby, namely ruby letters that are attached to two or more base characters as one object (note that ruby characters are not limited to <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_6-en"></a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>), is called <a class="termref" href="#term.group-ruby">group-ruby</a>. Group-ruby and it's base characters are unbreakable, because of their behavior as one object (it is possible to break a line in the middle of the base characters where <a class="termref2nd" href="#term.jukugo-ruby">jukugo-ruby</a> is in use).</p>

              <p> Having said that, the layout of ruby text to a single <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> is not entirely the same depending on the use of ruby, and may differ according to
                whether it is for indicating the reading or the meaning. In fact, the <a href="#term.katatsuki" class="termref">katatsuki</a>, one of ruby layout per character which will

            base text (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>).
            There are opposite cases where a synonymous Western word in Latin characters is attached as a ruby annotation to a Japanese
            word in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and so on (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>).

          <aside class="note">
              <p> There is no difference in the positioning of ruby text whether attaching ruby characters in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> to a Western word in Latin characters or attaching ruby in Latin to a Japanese word in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>. The ruby text in either case should be positioned relative to a run of base text to be annotated as in b).

On the other hand, when the base text or ruby text is Latin word, the word is set with western solid setting, and no inter-character space will be added to any ruby or base text in Latin characters no matter how different the ruby and base text look in length (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>).

      <h4 id="choice_of_size_for_ruby_characters">Choice of Size for Ruby Characters</h4>
      <p> The <a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">character size</a> of ruby characters is, in principle, the half size of the base characters (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_9-en"></a>). </p>

	</figure>
      <p> The '<a href="#term.one-third-ruby" class="termref">one-third-ruby</a>' characters are  used on rare occasions to attach three ruby characters to one <a href="#term.full-width" class="termref">full-width</a> <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>. One-third-ruby for vertical layout has the dimension of the half of the base character in width and the one third in height. Those
        for horizontal writing mode have the dimension of half of the base characters in height and one third in width (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_10-en"></a>). </p>

      <p> When ruby is attached to twelve point or larger base characters (usually used for headings), the size of the ruby letter is generally smaller than half the size of the base characters, considering the proportion of the sizes
        of base characters and ruby. When all is said and done, these cases are very rare.</p>

      <aside class="note">
      <p> There are cases where the body size is twelve points in books designed for infants or aged people. In these cases, the

            </aside>
            <aside class="note">
      <p> When the size of base characters is very small (for e.g. smaller than seven points), ruby which is half the
            size, will be even more small and illegible. In such cases where the size of base characters is very small, ruby is not
            a suitable method of annotation. In those cases, consider other annotation methods such as adding the reading in parenthesis immediately
            after the base character. </p>
            </aside>
            <aside class="note">
      <p> Slightly different from the question of the size of ruby, there is a question of whether or not <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-11">small kana (cl-11)</a> characters should be used

            Today there are cases where small kana are used in ruby annotations, but taking legibility into consideration, these cases should be

      <h4 id="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters">Positioning of Mono-ruby with Respect to Base Characters</h4>
      <p> When <a href="#term.mono-ruby" class="termref2nd">mono-ruby</a> characters are Japanese, they are <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">set solid</a>. If mono-ruby characters have their own character widths such as
        Western characters or <a href="#term.european-numerals" class="termref">European numerals</a>, they are set according to their own widths and then the ruby text is placed so that its center
        matches that of its base character. There are more variations depending on the combination of the base character
        and ruby text and accordingly various composition rules have been invented, which will be explained with examples. </p>
      <p> When attaching two <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby characters to a single base character, the lengths of the ruby text and the base text are the same and they are positioned as shown

      <p> When attaching a single <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby character to a single base character, there are two ways of positioning the ruby character. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p> In <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref2nd">vertical writing mode</a>, attach a ruby character so that its vertical center matches that of the base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_14-en"></a>).
            In <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref2nd">horizontal writing mode</a>, attach a ruby character so that its horizontal center matches that of the base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_14-en"></a>).
            This positioning of a ruby character is called '<a href="#term.nakatsuki" class="termref">nakatsuki</a>' (center-alignment). </p>
          <figure id="fig2_3_14-en">

        </li>
        <li>

            character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_14-en"></a>). This positioning of a ruby character is called 'katatsuki' (top-alignment).
            For horizontal writing mode, '<a href="#term.katatsuki" class="termref2nd">katatsuki</a>' should not be adopted. If a ruby character is attached so that the left-edge of its virtual
            body is aligned with the left-edge of that of the base character, it would result in the loss of the center of balance, which
            doesn't look good (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_15-en"></a>). </p>

      <p> When attaching three or more <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby characters to a single base character, the ruby characters are set solid. In this
        case, where the length of a ruby text is longer than that of its base character, positioning of the ruby text depends
        on which alignment has been adopted for a single ruby character. There is another issue: how to maintain the spatial balance
        of the ruby characters hanging over those characters which are not related base characters. The adjustment of inter-character
        spacing for those characters which come before and after the base character will be explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters">3.3.8 Adjustments of Ruby with Length Longer than that of the Base Characters</a>. </p>

                on both adjacent characters. At break-even situation, the hangover is usually on the character after its base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_17-en"></a>). </p>

      <p> When the length of a sequence of base characters (number of characters * advance-width of each character) and that

      <p>When the length of the ruby text is shorter than that of its base characters, set the base text solid and  attached ruby character, so that both texts balance each other. To be more specific, where 2 units of inter-character space are used between ruby characters, add 1 unit of space between the start of  the base text and the start of the ruby text, and between the end of the ruby text and the end of the base text. This  will give a balanced appearance, and is the method specified in JIS X 4051 (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_19-en"></a>). Another way is to first align the leading characters for both the base text and ruby text and the ends of both trailing characters, and then add the same amount of inter-character space between the rest of the ruby characters (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_20-en"></a>).</p>

      <p> In letterpress printing, there were not many choices for adjustment of inter-character space between ruby characters. Therefore,
            depending on the number of characters in the base text and its ruby text, the choice was whether to add a certain amount of space
            before the leading ruby character and after the trailing character, or not. In the former case it had been said that for 2
            units of inter-character space between each c ruby characters, adding 1 unit of the leading and trailing space would

            Therefore, a criterion for deciding whether or not to adopt the method of JIS X 4051 is to see if the amount of the leading and the trailing
            space exceeds the full-width size (or up to 1.5 times the size) of a ruby character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_21-en"></a>). </p>

      <p> <a href="#term.emphasis-dots" class="termref">Emphasis dots</a> (also known as bouten or side dots) are symbols placed alongside a run of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> characters to emphasize
        the text. </p>
      <aside class="note">
      <p> There are many ways to emphasize a run of text in Japanese composition. Besides attaching emphasis dots, one may emphasize
            a certain run of text by selecting a different <a href="#term.typeface" class="termref">typeface</a> (for example, Mincho face for normal text and <a href="#term.japanese-gothic-face" class="termref">Japanese gothic face</a> for emphasis),
            a different color (for example, turning to red for emphasis), by enclosing the text within brackets (for example, <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT CORNER BRACKET "」"</span> or <span class="character">LEFT ANGLE BRACKET "〈"</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET "〉"</span>), by drawing a line alongside the text (or <a href="#term.bousen" class="termref">bousen</a>, <a href="#term.underline" class="termref">underlining</a> the text), and so on. It is an editorial decision
            which emphasis method to adopt. Selecting a different typeface and enclosing text within brackets are generally used and
            popular emphasis methods. Attaching emphasis dots is not very common but one of the long-established and traditional methods typically

      <p><a href="#term.warichu" class="termref">Warichu</a> (inline cutting note) is a type of inline notation, where two lines of small characters are inserted into the text. Warichu divides a line into two sub lines. The frequency of use of the inline cutting note is not so high. However,
        the inline cutting note is very important for study guides, travel guides, reference books, encyclopedias and manuals,  because it is very effective for inserting notes at the point in the text where they are needed (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_1-en"></a>). Inline cutting note is usually used in <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a>. It is very infrequently used in <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">Character size</a> for an inline cutting note depends on the  character size established for the kihon-hanmen. Usually, around six point size is used (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_1-en"></a>).</p>
      <p>The space between adjacent lines in an inline cutting note is zero, that is to say, there is no <a href="#term.line-gap" class="termref">line gap</a> between them (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_2-en"></a>).</p>
      <p>As shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_2-en"></a>, an inline cutting note usually has two lines, and is surrounded by <span class="character">LEFT PARENTHESIS "("</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT PARENTHESIS ")"</span> characters that are double the size of the characters in the inline cutting note itself. There is no space between the surrounding text and parentheses for the inline cutting note.</p>

      <p>Symbols, like <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> are also used in inline cutting note text. In such cases, the handling of such symbols is the same as for the <a href="#term.main-text" class="termref">main text</a>.</p>
      <p>In vertical text, the horizontal width of the inline cutting note area is wider than the width of a <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a> line. The horizontal centers of the kihon-hanmen line and inline cutting note area are aligned. The line gap used to establish the kihon-hanmen should not be affected by the horizontal
        width of the inline cutting note area.
        In other words, the line gap for the kihon-hanmen needs to be designed wider than usual in preparation for the use of the  inline cutting note. (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_18-en"></a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_1-en"></a>) Warichu is used also in horizontal text, however it is not so common, and usually occurs only in study guides and encyclopedias.</p>
      <p>The length of the two lines of the inline cutting note should be as near as possible the same. When the inline cutting note can be set in one kihon-hanmen line, the whole inline note text should be broken at a position where line breaking is permitted, and where the two resulting lines are as close as possible to the same length. The length of the second line should not be longer than the length of the first line. Note that the same line breaking rules are used as for basic text  (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_3-en"></a>).</p>

      <p> For <a href="#term.quotation" class="termref2nd">quotations</a> on separate lines, there are the following approaches: either (a) the character size is the same as for the main text, and the difference from the main text is expressed only by the line head indent; or (b) the character size is made smaller than that of the main text. The former approach is applied frequently. With this approach, the line head indent is often set at double the normal character size of the main text. If large quotations are inserted frequently, there is also an approach that uses a full-width line head indent with an empty line inserted before and after the quotation. The approach where characters are made smaller than the main text is &lt;ins&gt;same as the processing of endnotes&lt;/ins&gt; , see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_endnotes_in_vertical_writing_mode_or_horizontal_writing_mode"></a>).</p>

      <p>The size of the line-feed space of the paragraph which contains the furiwake block, should be explicitly indicated.
        The space should be decided by considering the content of the furiwake block, and may therefore differ from the size of the line-feed space  of kihon-hanmen.</p>
      <p>In general, the width of the furiwake block is larger than the width of an inline cutting note block. However, unlike in the case of the inline cutting block, the whole furiwake block should
        be set inside of the kihon-hanmen, or a <a href="#term.column" class="termref">column</a> of the kihon-hanmen Setting a furiwake block that extends beyond the border of the kihon-hanmen

      <h4 id="jidori_processing">Jidori Processing</h4>
      <p>In cases such as lists of names of Japanese people, the length of some part of the text may be explicitly defined. In such cases, different numbers of characters are set, using adjustment of the inter-character spacing, so that they are all aligned to the same length. This is called <a href="#term.jidori" class="termref">jidori</a> processing
        (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_7_4-en"></a>).</p>

      <p>Sometimes, in <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>, text in <a href="#term.running-head" class="termref">running heads</a> (with the exception of chapter and section numbers) are set using jidori processing. For example, three to six characters are set in a 7 character space (based on the size of the characters in the running head (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_7_5-en"></a>). Two characters are set in a 6 character space to avoid too much space. Seven characters are set solid in a seven character space, and eight or more characters are set solid in a space of eight or more characters. This rule can be applied to other numbers of characters, such as five, six and eight.</p>

      <p>Jidori processing should be done as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The length for the jidori processing should be defined as a whole number of full-width characters at the size defined for the surrounding text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The jidori text should be adjusted using spacing between characters so that the sides of the text are aligned at the defined length. The following, however, should be set solid:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Positions where line breaks are prohibited: inter-character spaces between European numerals; between two <span class="character">EM DASH "—"</span> characters; between two <span class="character">TWO DOT LEADER "‥"</span> characters; between two <span class="character">HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS "…"</span> characters; and so on. These sequences should be treated as a single block.</p>
              <aside class="note">
      <p>The handling of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> in jidori processing is also very controversial. Usually, the space before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> is set solid. In jidori processing, the space before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and the space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> may be used for line adjustment, but the space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and the space before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> should not used for adjustment, because it is prohibited to break lines in these positions. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_7_52-en"></a> shows one example with even spacing for all characters, a second example as explained here, and a third example that is set solid before and after the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment" class="termref">Line adjustment</a> processing is applied where inter-character adjustments are needed to bring the line end into the correct alignment, e.g. because of <a href="#term.line-breaking-rules" class="termref">line wrap</a> or other reasons. Within a paragraph, lines are created by separating character sequences at places where line breaking is not prohibited. Except for the end
        of the last line of a paragraph, it is necessary to set the head
        and end
        of each line at predicable,
        aligned positions. For the last line of the paragraph, it is still necessary to set the head at the aligned position, however the line end  need not aligned to the other alignment position. To achieve this, only inter-character spacing indicated in the table of <a class="sec_ref" href="#spacing_between_characters"></a>, or explicitly chosen  space sizes, are inserted, and other inter-character spaces are set solid. </p>
      <aside class="note">
      <p>In Japanese composition, there is no concept corresponding to the Western "ragged right (flush left)", "ragged left (flush right)", or "ragged center". In Japanese composition, especially common book composition, usually only "justification" is applied. Note that, in Western composition, "justification" is usually applied for only word space sizes. In Japanese composition, it is applied for not only <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a> but also in several other places as explained in following text.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
      <p>Usually, the last line of a paragraph needs no adjustment. However, when the last line of a paragraph is a little bit longer than the line length, inter-character space
            reduction is applied for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> and at other places, if possible.</p>
            </aside>
            <aside class="note">
      <p>There is another adjustment processing, besides line adjustment, called "single line alignment". Single line alignment is applied to align a run of the text that is shorter than a given line length to designated positions.

        <li>
          <p>Mixed use of characters and symbols (e.g. <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-24">grouped numerals (cl-24)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a>) where not all characters are full-width

For example, a sequence of a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing bracket (cl-02)</a> and a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stop (cl-06)</a> takes one and a half em spaces together (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_52-en"></a>). However, if an <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a> follows immediately after the full stop, these punctuation marks will need two em size spaces together. Hence, no adjustment is needed to correctly align the line end (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_52-en"></a>).</p>

      <p>Line adjustment processing targets places with a predefined space size  or solid setting. Methods for line adjustment are as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-reduction" class="termref">Line adjustment by inter-character space reduction</a>. This means that a <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref">half em space</a> is reduced after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, or before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a> is reduced
            within a defined limit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-expansion" class="termref">Line adjustment by inter-character space expansion</a>. Line adjustment by inter-character space expansion means expanding inter-character space for line adjustment, where inter-character space is allowed to be extended up to a defined limit, such as for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a> or other places where it is not prohibited to extend inter-character space.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Normally line adjustment by inter-character space reduction is preferred. Only when there are no spaces that can be reduced is line adjustment by inter-character
        space expansion applied. The reason for the preference of line adjustment by inter-character space reduction comes from
        the thinking that characters in solid setting should not have more inter character space, if at all possible.</p>
      <aside class="note">
      <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-hanging-punctuation" class="termref">Line adjustment by hanging punctuation</a> is a method of avoiding line head wrap of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a>. This method is not formally defined in JIS X 4051, however JIS
            X 4051 does provide explanatory material about it. </p>
            <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-hanging-punctuation" class="termref">Line adjustment by hanging punctuation</a> is a method which is only applied to <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a>. These touch the <a href="#term.hanmen" class="termref">hanmen</a> and
              are set in  a place outside the defined line length (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_54-en"></a>). This is also applied, for example, in books, in order to avoid the addition of inter character space and maintain  solid setting. However,
              line adjustment by hanging punctuation is not an appropriate method for dealing with a mixture of Japanese and Latin script text, since the latter principally does not apply line adjustment by hanging punctuation. In addition, there is another argument against
              line adjustment by hanging punctuation. Originally it was a method used in letterpress printing, to make the task of line
              adjustment easier. Furthermore, as shown at the end of line 1 and 5 of <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_54-en"></a>, if possible the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> are placed at the line end (the 18th position). In DTP there are examples of hanging punctuation
              like in line 3, but this may be regarded as unnecessary processing. </p>

      <p>For each character class it is possible to describe whether the characters may appear at the line head or line end or not,
        the positioning method for the line head or line end positions (if available), the amount of space between sequences of several
        characters, and the combination with character classes before or after the characters (in a 2 dimensional table). In JIS X
        4051 this is shown in table 5 "Amount of space (between characters)". </p>
      <aside class="note">
     		<p>For the presentation as a two dimensional table, it becomes necessary for each class to have separate items about "line head"
            (the column about the character classes appearing before) and "line end" (the column about the character classes appearing
            after). If it is forbidden that the characters of the class appear at the line head or line end, JIS X 4051 uses an "X" mark
            in the columns for "line head" and "line end". </p>
            </aside>
      <p>Also, it can be defined for each combination of the character classes (in a two dimensional table) whether the characters
        of classes appearing in sequence allow for  a line break between them, or whether it is possible during line
        adjustment processing to add inter character space between them. In JIS X 4051 these items are also shown in a two dimensional table.
        Table 6 shows whether a line break is possible, and table 7 shows if it is possible to add inter character space. </p>
      <aside class="note">
     		<p>It is also possible to define for each combination of character classes whether it is possible to apply kerning during line
            adjustment processing for character classes appearing in sequence. However, JIS X 4051 does not provide this information as
            a two dimensional table, but only as a textual description. </p>
